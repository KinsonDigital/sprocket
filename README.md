<h1 style="border:0;font-weight:bold" align="center">sprocket</h1>

sprocket is a CLI application written in [deno](https://deno.com/) to simplify dev-related work in the KinsonDigital organization.

### Install/Update
```bash
# Installs or updates the tool
deno run -NRW jsr:@kinsondigital/sprocket/installation/install.ts
```

### Note:

You can name your sprocket config file anything you want as well as put it anywhere you want in
the project.  Updating the version of the tool in the deno.json file using the install command
above does not remove or malform the path to the config file.
